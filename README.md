# ubuwebplugin
So save everything in this folder onto your desktop in a folder called something like Ubuweb Chrome Extension then go to chrome://extensions/ and click the developer mode toggle in the top right and then click the button in the top left that says load unpacked and load the folder you just made. Let me know if you come across any bugs. All information is stored locally.
